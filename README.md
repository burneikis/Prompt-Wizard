# Prompt Wizard
## Concept
Prompt Wizard is an interactive web-based RPG where high school students learn AI literacy by crafting text prompts (spells) to battle mystical creatures. Players discover that the effectiveness of their magic depends entirely on how well they can communicate with an AI system—teaching core concepts of prompt engineering, AI behavior, and responsible AI interaction.

## Educational Objectives (AI Literacy Skills)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Understanding how specific, clear instructions yield better AI responses
- **AI Probabilistic Nature**: Learning that AI outputs vary and aren't always predictable
- **Responsible AI Use**: Understanding ethical considerations when interacting with AI systems

## Gameplay Mechanics
### Core Loop:
- **Encounter Phase**: Students face creatures with different vulnerabilities (fire dragon, logic puzzle sphinx, creative arts phoenix)
- **Spell Crafting**: Players write text prompts to cast spells, with guidance on effective prompt structure
- **AI Evaluation**: The LLM API judges prompt effectiveness based on clarity, specificity, and appropriateness
- **Battle Resolution**: Success depends on prompt quality—vague prompts might backfire, while well-crafted ones deal maximum damage
- **Reflection**: After each battle, students see why certain prompts worked better than others

### Safety Features:

- All prompts are filtered through content moderation
- No free-form text output—AI responses are structured and curated
- Educational tooltips explain AI concepts
- Built-in reflection moments to discuss AI limitations and responsible use

### Technical Innovation
The game uses a sophisticated prompt evaluation system that teaches students about:

- How specificity improves AI performance
- Why context matters in AI communication
- How to recognize and prevent AI mistakes

### Unique Value Proposition
Unlike traditional educational games, Prompt Wizard makes AI literacy tangible and immediately rewarding. Students don't just learn about AI—they actively practice communicating with it, building practical skills they'll use throughout their lives while understanding the technology's capabilities and limitations.
This concept aligns perfectly with the competition's goals of teaching AI literacy (not programming), creating accessible and engaging content for Years 7-10, and demonstrating innovative use of Generative AI in education.

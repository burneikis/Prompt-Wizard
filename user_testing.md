# Testing
Sent it to my mate lachlan for feedback.

## Notes
- heal spell, needs to be added (should be detected that the user wants to heal, and how much by)
- same spell as before (i think it pretends to have memory not sure tho)
- maybe add a spell history feature for the ai
- too random and lenient at times with numbers
- show (unmoderated) spell history to the left side
- add enter to submit spell, (shift enter shouldn't)
- you cant go back to past stages
- "dumb attack" was filtered

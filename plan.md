# Prompt Wizard - Devlopment Plan

## Phase 1: Setup & Basic Prototype

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [ ] Create React app and Node.js backend
- [ ] Set up OpenAI API integration (gpt-5-nano)
- [ ] Basic project structure and git repository

### 1.2 Single Encounter Prototype
- [ ] Create simple creature (e.g., Fire Dragon)
- [ ] Build basic prompt input interface
- [ ] Implement OpenAI API call to evaluate prompt effectiveness
- [ ] Display simple battle result (hit/miss/critical)
- [ ] Add basic creature health/damage system

## Phase 2: Core Game Loop

### 2.1 Expand Encounter System
- [ ] Add 2-3 more creatures with different weaknesses
- [ ] Implement creature selection/progression
- [ ] Basic win/lose conditions
- [ ] Simple scoring system

### 2.2 Improve Prompt Evaluation
- [ ] Refine OpenAI prompts for consistent spell evaluation
- [ ] Add different spell types (fire, logic, creative)
- [ ] Basic feedback on why prompts worked/failed

## Phase 3: Polish & Safety

### 3.1 User Experience
- [ ] Improve UI/UX with basic styling
- [ ] Add simple animations for battles
- [ ] Tutorial for first-time players
- [ ] Basic progress tracking

### 3.2 Content Moderation
- [ ] Add basic content filtering for inappropriate prompts
- [ ] Implement simple safety checks
- [ ] Error handling for API failures

## Phase 4: Deploy & Test

### 4.1 Deployment
- [ ] Deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
- [ ] Deploy backend (Railway/Heroku)
- [ ] Test full system works online

### 4.2 Basic Testing
- [ ] Test with a few users
- [ ] Fix major bugs
- [ ] Ensure game is playable end-to-end

## Phase 5: Competition Deliverables

### 5.1 Documentation
- [ ] Create 3-minute demo video
- [ ] Write technical writeup PDF
- [ ] Clean up code repository
- [ ] Submit all materials

## Future Enhancements (Post-Competition)
- More creatures and spell types
- Advanced prompt evaluation
- Multiplayer features
- Teacher dashboard
- Detailed analytics

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **AI**: OpenAI gpt-5-nano
- **Deployment**: Vercel + Railway
- **Database**: Start with JSON files, upgrade to MongoDB later if needed

## MVP Features for Prototype
1. One creature encounter
2. Text input for spells
3. AI evaluation of spell effectiveness
4. Basic battle resolution
5. Simple win/lose feedback

Keep it simple, make it work, then iterate!

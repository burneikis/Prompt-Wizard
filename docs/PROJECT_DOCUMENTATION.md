## Project Overview

**Prompt Wizard** is an innovative web-based RPG designed to teach AI literacy to high school students (Years 7-10). The game transforms the abstract concept of prompt engineering into an engaging, interactive experience where students learn to communicate effectively with AI systems through magical spell crafting.

### Core Concept
Students battle mystical creatures by writing text prompts (spells) that are evaluated by an AI system. The effectiveness of their magic depends entirely on how well they communicate their intentions‚Äîteaching prompt engineering principles through gameplay mechanics.

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: High school students (Years 7-10, ages 12-16)
- **Secondary**: Educators seeking AI literacy curriculum tools
- **Context**: Suitable for classroom use or independent learning

## Educational Objectives

### Primary Learning Goals
1. **Prompt Engineering Mastery**
   - Understanding that specificity and clarity improve AI responses
   - Learning to structure requests for optimal results
   - Recognizing the importance of context and detail

2. **AI System Understanding**
   - Comprehending the probabilistic nature of AI outputs
   - Understanding that AI responses can vary for identical inputs
   - Learning about AI limitations and capabilities

3. **Responsible AI Interaction**
   - Ethical considerations when using AI systems
   - Understanding content moderation and safety measures
   - Developing critical thinking about AI-generated content

3. **Moderation Check**: System validates prompt for appropriate content
4. **AI Evaluation**: OpenAI API evaluates prompt effectiveness
5. **Battle Resolution**: Result applied to game state (damage, healing, effects)
6. **Educational Feedback**: System explains why the prompt was effective or not

### Creature System
